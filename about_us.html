		    <p>Once upon a time, in a cozy little workshop nestled in the heart of a bustling city, a group of passionate artisans discovered the secret to turning ordinary lamps into something truly magical. They didn’t just create lamps—they created stories. Each lamp had a soul, its glow a reflection of a unique journey that began with the first flicker of light and continued through generations. This was the birth of GlowLight, a company founded on the belief that light has the power to tell stories, brighten spaces, and bring warmth to every corner of your life.</p>

			    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
			    <p><span class="highlight">To create high-quality, unique lamps</span> that not only serve as functional lighting but also add personality and character to any space. We believe each lamp should tell a story, just like every room deserves to have its own character.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="story">	
			 <p>We are a family from <strong>Ukraine</strong>, and we’ve decided to open our store to bring our love for unique, handcrafted lamps to the world. In a world where mass-produced items often take center stage, we wanted to offer something different—something with a story, a soul, and lasting beauty. Our roots, deeply embedded in Ukrainian craftsmanship and culture, inspire us every day to create products that not only light up a room but also bring warmth, comfort, and a sense of connection. GlowLight is more than just a store; it’s a reflection of our heritage and passion for lighting up your life with the finest, most thoughtful designs.</p>
